# Changing Base

Given an integer (represented as a string) under base b1, convert it to base b2.

Example 1:

	Input: ("12", 10, 2)
    Output: "1100"
    Explanation: We are converting "12" which is under base 10 (decimal) to base 2 (binary)

Example 2:

    Input: ("123", 4, 10)
    Output: "27"
    Explanation: We are converting "123" which is under base 4 (quaternary) to base 10

Example 3:

    Input: ("123", 4, 16)
    Output: "1B"
    Explanation: Convert "123" from base 4 to 16

Example 4:

	Input: ("123", 10, 10)
	Output: "123"

Constraints:
- 2 <= b1 <= 36
- 2 <= b2 <= 36
- For base-2 up to base-10 use the digits 0-9 to represent digits
- Use the English alphabet characters A-Z in base-11 and higher
